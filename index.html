                    <h4><u>Read the Passage carefully and answers the following Questions:-</u></h4>
                    <br>
                <p>Curie was one of the most accomplished scientists in history. Together with her husband,
                    Pierre, she discovered radium, an element widely used for treating cancer, and studied uranium 
                    and other radioactive substances. Pierre and Marie's amicable collaboration later helped to
                    unlock the secrets of the atom.</p>
                    <p>Marie was born in 1867 in Warsaw, Poland, where her father was a professor of physics. At the
                    early age, she displayed a brilliant mind and a blithe personality. Her great exuberance for
                    learning prompted her to continue with her studies after high school. She became disgruntled,
                    however, when she learned that the university in Warsaw was closed to women. Determined to
                    receive a higher education, she defiantly left Poland and in 1891 entered the Sorbonne, a French
                    university, where she earned her master's degree and doctorate in physics.</p>
                <p>Marie was fortunate to have studied at the Sorbonne with some of the greatest scientists of her
                    day, one of whom was Pierre Curie. Marie and Pierre were married in 1895 and spent many
                    productive years working together in the physics laboratory. A short time after they discovered
                    radium, Pierre was killed by a horse-drawn wagon in 1906. Marie was stunned by this horrible
                    misfortune and endured heartbreaking anguish. Despondently she recalled their close
                    relationship and the joy that they had shared in scientific research. The fact that she had two
                    young daughters to raise by herself greatly increased her distress.</p>
                <p>Curie's feeling of desolation finally began to fade when she was asked to succeed her husband as
                    a physics professor at the Sorbonne. She was the first woman to be given a professorship at the
                    world-famous university. In 1911 she received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for isolating radium.
                    Although Marie Curie eventually suffered a fatal illness from her long exposure to radium, she
                    never became disillusioned about her work. Regardless of the consequences, she had dedicated
                    herself to science and to revealing the mysteries of the physical world.</p>
